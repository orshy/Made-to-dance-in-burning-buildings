              <p>Six hundred people are raped every day in the United States, <strong>1 person every 2 minutes.</strong> There are <strong>157 million women</strong> in the United States and <strong> 1 in 3 of them is a survivor of sexual assault or rape.</strong> Like most survivors of rape, women are at an increased risk for developing depression, PTSD, and addiction. PTSD affects hundred of thousands of people who have been exposed to violent events such as rape. Sometimes survivors become stuck in problem behaviors when their pain is not acknowledged, heard, respected, or understood.</br ></br >
              Because of the pervasive nature of rape culture, the victim is often blamed for the assault. This leads many women to not report their rapes. Women choose to “suffer in silence” rather than seek help to protect themselves from victim-blaming and the humiliation they face when they do come forward. Only <strong>1 in 6 reported cases</strong> ever see the inside of a courtroom. <strong>97% of rapists never spend a day in jail.</strong> </br ></br >
              Shot on location in Portland, Oregon and New York City, <i>Forever Bruised But Not Broken</i> dives into the issue of multi-cultural women and sexual assault. It asks why this is happening and why so little is being done to help these women. It profiles the lives of four survivors of diverse backgrounds and their experiences with PTSD. And it chronicles one women's journey to make a difference in the fight against rape culture in our community.</br ></br >
              The film tells the story of Anya Pearson who is a survivor. An accomplished actress and writer, she’s written a play about women and rape which she is to bringing to the stage, to empower other survivors. This is her journey. The journey of the play, from page to stage. Anya's passionate quest to effect real meaningful social change through the arts. Can she make a difference in the lives of other survivors with her play? Can she change the world through the power of theater? Can she heal herself by healing others?</p>

            <p class="generic-content-container--synopsis"><i>Made to Dance in Burning Buildings</i> is a choreopoem, which fuses poetry, music, and violent and visceral contemporary dance posing the question: how do we heal from trauma? It's about a young black woman who is raped by her boyfriend's friends while he watches and develops PTSD as a result. Metaphorically, she fractures into six different women who each represent a different facet of her personality (Compassion, Despair, Madness, Romance, Missing You, and Perseverance) and these women poetically narrate her journey through PTSD, while she and the men from her real life, her first love and her abusers, explore through dance, the trauma and what led up to it. <br><br></p>
